When "Generate Password" button is hit, 

User is asked to choose a Password Length between 8-128

User is asked to choose 4 parameters for the password

     1.Lowercase Letters
     2. Uppercase Letters
     3. Numbers
     4. Special Characters
     
Each option chose will ad to the pool of available characters for the password.
 
      User must choose at least one option.
      
At the end, the selected options will be gone through at random to create a password of the 
selected length.

I used .toUpperCase on the Lowercase letters
I used ".textcontent" to set the new password
